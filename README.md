# PACT Conformance Tool

### About this Project
PACT publishes  [Technical Specifications for PCF Data Exchange](https://docs.carbon-transparency.org/v2/), which any organization or company can implement. Software solutions that implement the PACT Technical Specifications are known as [PACT Conformant Solutions](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network). This GitHub repository creates a conformance tool which enables organizations to automatically assess their implementation of the specifications, and become PACT Conformant. The tool is a service of [PACT Network Services](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/pact-network-services).

###  Context
PACT began running a conformance testing process in May 2023, shortly after the publication of V2 of the PACT Technical Specifications. From May 2023 to February 2025, conformance was conducted through manual peer-to-peer testing, [learn more here](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/guides/guide-join-pact-network). This conformance tool replaces the peer-to-peer testing process, which both accelerates testing and improves the rigor and reliability of PACT Conformance status.

### Access the tool
Use of the tool is free and open to anyone. See [Testing Guide](docs/MVP_testing_guide.md) to get started!

### Timeline
- PACT released an MVP version of the service in March 2025, which can now be used for testing. 
- PACT will release a production version of the service in June 2025, which must be used to gain PACT Conformance status

### Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the generous time and contributions from the following:
- [Takuro Okada](mailto:t2-okada@nri.co.jp), who built an open-source command-line automated conformance testing tool and released this to the PACT community in September 2024, which served as a foundation and inspiration for this project
- [SINE Foundation](https://sine.foundation/), who proposed and built an early automated conformance testing tool, and advocated for the introduction of such a tool to the community
- [Patrick J McGovern Foundation](https://www.mcgovern.org/) for generously supporting this work
- The PACT community for active engagement and testing of the tool, and for providing feedback
